intro: >
  I am currently working as a Data Science and Human Rights Research Specialist at the World Bank, 
  where I combine my academic background in data science and human rights to address global challenges. 
  My work focuses on using advanced AI/ML methodologies to promote inclusive growth and combat discrimination, 
  contributing to the World Bank's mission of fostering opportunities for the 2.3+ billion people globally 
  facing social exclusion.

items:
  - title: "Human Rights Economy Research"
    description: >
      Leading research to define and scope the emerging field of the human rights economy through 
      interdisciplinary legal and economic analysis. This foundational work aims to establish frameworks 
      for understanding how human rights principles can be integrated into economic systems and policy-making 
      at a global scale.
    subtitle: "Innovative Research at the Intersection of Rights and Economics"
    details: >
      This project represents work in a developing field that bridges traditional human rights 
      advocacy with economic development strategies. As this research is in its scoping phases, it will lay 
      groundwork for future World Bank initiatives that embed human rights considerations into economic 
      development projects. The findings will contribute to policy frameworks that ensure economic growth 
      serves human dignity and rights protection.

  - title: "AI-Driven Analysis of Female Workforce Participation"
    description: >
      Applying machine learning and artificial intelligence methodologies to analyze patterns of female 
      participation in the workforce, with particular focus on identifying and addressing discrimination 
      barriers. This research utilizes comprehensive regional datasets to predict participation patterns 
      in the absence of gender-based discrimination.
    subtitle: "Combating Gender Discrimination Through Data Science"
    details: >
      This project leverages multiple regional barometers including the Latinobarómetro and Arab Barometer, 
      which contain rich data on discrimination experiences and attitudes. By applying advanced AI/ML techniques 
      to this data, we can identify systemic patterns of exclusion and develop evidence-based interventions 
      to promote women's workforce participation. The project directly contributes to the World Bank's goals 
      of fostering inclusive structures worldwide.

  - title: "Thesis Research: The Right to be Forgotten in the Age of Artificial Intelligence: Meta's Implementation Problems"
    description: >
      Completed comprehensive research examining the right to be forgotten in the context of Large Language 
      Models, analyzing how artificial intelligence systems challenge traditional privacy frameworks. My thesis 
      investigated Meta's implementation of privacy policies across EU and US jurisdictions, revealing fundamental 
      tensions between technological capabilities and legal protections.
    subtitle: "Bridging Technology and Human Rights"
    details: >
      This research demonstrates how current privacy laws—designed for earlier technological paradigms—struggle 
      to address the realities of AI systems where data becomes embedded in neural networks. The work proposes 
      a "progressive realization" approach to privacy rights that acknowledges technological constraints while 
      maintaining meaningful protection for individuals. The findings contribute to ongoing policy debates about 
      AI governance and digital rights.
  - title: "Global Human Rights Lab"
    description: >
      The Pozen Center's Global Human Rights Lab accepted qualified undergraduate students to 
      conduct research with the University of Chicago Law School's Global Human Rights Clinic. 
      Our research teams worked collaboratively to gather and analyze critical data on human rights 
      violations, producing reports and documentation that directly supported the work of the United 
      Nations and other international partners. The Lab provided hands-on experience in human rights 
      research while contributing to real-world initiatives for justice and accountability.
    subtitle: "Impact & Opportunities" 
    details: >
      This research position offered a unique opportunity to develop advanced qualitative research 
      skills while contributing to vital work in the human rights space. I was particularly excited 
      to assist with high-impact projects, such as supporting the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial,
       Summary, or Arbitrary Executions and documenting civilian casualties in ongoing armed conflicts.
        The gravity and importance of this work - helping to shed light on human rights violations and 
        support accountability efforts - made me deeply honored to be part of these initiatives. Working 
        directly with the United Nations brought my academic journey full circle, building meaningfully on 
        my foundational experience with Model UN and crystallizing many of the core interests I had pursued
        throughout my undergraduate studies. This role represented not just a professional opportunity, but
         a chance to contribute to work that aligned deeply with my values and aspirations in human rights advocacy.
  - title: "Model United Nations (MUN)"
    description: >
      As President of UChicago's Model UN competitive team, I led one of the nation's premier collegiate MUN programs,
       consistently ranked in the top five nationally. This leadership role involved directing comprehensive training 
       programs for sixty team members, focusing on public speaking, international relations analysis, project management,
        and inclusive leadership practices. Our program combined rigorous academic preparation with practical diplomatic 
        skills development, maintaining UChicago's legacy of excellence in collegiate Model UN competition.
    subtitle: "Leadership & Achievements"
    details: >
        Under my leadership, our team secured Best Large Delegation at Georgetown's National Collegiate Security 
        Conference (NCSC), the most prestigious fall competition in collegiate Model UN. Beyond competitive achievements, 
        this role profoundly shaped my leadership philosophy and capabilities. I developed expertise in strategic
         team management, personalized mentorship, and creating an inclusive team culture that balanced competitive
          excellence with individual growth. Managing a large, diverse team through high-stakes competitions honed 
          my skills in crisis management, adaptive leadership, and organizational development. This experience became 
          the cornerstone of my undergraduate leadership journey, providing invaluable lessons in building and maintaining
           high-performing teams while fostering a supportive community atmosphere.
  - title: "Data Science Clinic"
    description: >
      In the Data Science Clinic, I contributed to a collaborative project with Inclusive Development International to
       enhance PalmWatch, a supply chain transparency tool for the palm oil industry. Our team developed a comprehensive
        mapping system for human rights grievances, integrating this data with PalmWatch's existing supply chain tracking
         capabilities. This integration enabled users to monitor both corporate supply chains and associated human rights
          practices, creating a more robust accountability framework for the palm oil sector.
    subtitle: "Project Impact & Integration"
    details: >
      This project represented a perfect synthesis of my academic pursuits in data science and human rights. By applying
       data science methodologies to human rights documentation, we created actionable insights for corporate 
       accountability. Our work involved cleaning and structuring complex datasets of human rights violations, developing
        systematic mapping protocols, and ensuring seamless integration with the existing PalmWatch platform. This practical
         application of technical skills to advance human rights demonstrated the powerful intersection of technology and 
         social justice. The project exemplified how data-driven approaches could enhance transparency in global supply chains 
         and strengthen mechanisms for protecting human rights in international business operations.
