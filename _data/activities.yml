intro: >
  Here is all of my most important current activities, both professional and personally.
  Typically I try to go for depth rather than breadth. In my final year of undergrad I have 
  found amazing experiences to feel embedded within the departments of both of my majors, 
  and found a thesis topic that combines my interests to research a topical, important, and exciting field.

items:
  - title: "My Thesis"
    description: >
      For my thesis I am investigating the right to be forgotten and the onset of large language models (LLM)
      through an analysis of Meta's privacy policies in the EU, where the right is protected, and the United States,
      where it is not protected on the federal level.
    subtitle: "Why is this Important?"
    details: >
      As an emergent right, the right to be forgotten can provide us with the control over who collects, and stores our personal data.
      LLMs are quickly becoming the normal to use in your day to day activities, and are built on top of data that was collected without your knowledge.
      If someone wanted to remove their data in the past, they would submit a request to a company and processes would begin for their data to be expunged.
      But if the LLM is built on, even if a tiny part, of your personal data can this be protected? Meta operating within the EU and the US will need to navigate 
      this tension, and I cant wait to see how it will play out.

  - title: "Global Human Rights Lab"
    description: >
      The Pozen Center's Global Human Rights Lab accepts qualified undergraduate students to conduct research with the University of Chicago Law School's Global Human Rights Clinic.
      On these teams, students work gathering data on human rights violations for use by the United Nations and other global partners.
    subtitle: "Impact & Opportunities"
    details: >
      This position will give me an opportunity to develop qualitative research skills and connect me with impactful work in the human rights space. 
      Working on impactful projects such as supporting the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions, or documenting civilian casualties in armed conflict truly is important work, and I feel honored to assist in this work. 
      Lastly the ability to assist the work of the United Nations brings me full circle to my experience with Model UN, which ties a bow around a lot of my focus in Undergrad.

  - title: "Model United Nations (MUN)"
    description: >
      Currently, I am one of the presidents of the UChicago MUN competitive team. In this position I have had some of the most fulfilling experiences of my collegiate career.
      UChicago has never been ranked below fifth in the nation and there are no plans to end that now. Within this position, I lead trainings of sixty students on public speaking,
      international relations, project management, inclusive leadership, and collaboration.
    subtitle: "Conference Info"
    details: >
      Most recently we received Best Large Delegation from NCSC, (Georgetown's yearly conference) which is the largest and most competitive of the fall.
      For me however, competitive success aside, this position has taught me the most about mentorship, leadership, and organization than any other activity or group I have been a part of.

  - title: "Data Science Clinic"
    description: >
      Currently in the Data Science Clinic I am working on a project for Inclusive Development International mapping human rights grievances to an existing tool called PalmWatch.
      Palmwatch is a tool collecting and mapping data from the palm oil industry, with it users can track companies palm oil supply chains and determine what practices are being followed, 
      or what rights are being violated. With the team, we hope to deliver a cleaned dataset to then easily be added to the existing web-app.
    subtitle: "Project Impact"
    details: >
      What makes this project particularly exciting is that it combines my two majors, almost perfectly! The intersection of data science and human rights provides a unique opportunity
      to make a tangible impact on supply chain transparency and corporate accountability.
