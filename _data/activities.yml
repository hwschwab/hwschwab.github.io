intro: >
  Here is all of my most important current activities, both professional and personally.
  As I complete my undergraduate degree, I've developed deep connections within both of 
  my major departments. My thesis research uniquely combines these disciplines to address 
  pressing challenges in an emerging field. This focused approach has allowed me to build 
  meaningful expertise rather than spreading myself too thin across multiple areas.

  - title: "My Thesis"
    description: >
      My thesis examines the right to be forgotten in the context of
      large language models (LLMs) by analyzing Meta's privacy policies 
      in the EU, where this right is protected, and the United States, where
      federal protection is absent.
    subtitle: "Why is this Important?"
    details: >
      The right to be forgotten empowers individuals to control the collection
      and storage of their personal data. As LLMs become ubiquitous in daily life, 
      they raise new privacy concerns since they're trained on data collected without 
      explicit consent. While traditional data removal requests follow established
      procedures, LLMs present a unique challenge: how can personal data be protected 
      once it's incorporated into their training? Meta's operations in both the EU and 
      US serve as a case study for navigating these emerging tensions between privacy rights and AI development.

  - title: "Global Human Rights Lab"
    description: >
      The Pozen Center's Global Human Rights Lab accepts qualified undergraduate students to 
      conduct research with the University of Chicago Law School's Global Human Rights Clinic. 
      Our research teams work collaboratively to gather and analyze critical data on human rights 
      violations, producing reports and documentation that directly support the work of the United 
      Nations and other international partners. The Lab provides hands-on experience in human rights 
      research while contributing to real-world initiatives for justice and accountability.
    subtitle: "Impact & Opportunities" 
    details: >
      This research position offers a unique opportunity to develop advanced qualitative research 
      skills while contributing to vital work in the human rights space. I'm particularly excited 
      to assist with high-impact projects, such as supporting the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial,
       Summary, or Arbitrary Executions and documenting civilian casualties in ongoing armed conflicts.
        The gravity and importance of this work - helping to shed light on human rights violations and 
        support accountability efforts - makes me deeply honored to be part of these initiatives. Working 
        directly with the United Nations brings my academic journey full circle, building meaningfully on 
        my foundational experience with Model UN and crystallizing many of the core interests I've pursued
        throughout my undergraduate studies. This role represents not just a professional opportunity, but
         a chance to contribute to work that aligns deeply with my values and aspirations in human rights advocacy.
  - title: "Model United Nations (MUN)"
    description: >
      As President of UChicago's Model UN competitive team, I lead one of the nation's premier collegiate MUN programs,
       consistently ranked in the top five nationally. This leadership role involves directing comprehensive training 
       programs for sixty team members, focusing on public speaking, international relations analysis, project management,
        and inclusive leadership practices. Our program combines rigorous academic preparation with practical diplomatic 
        skills development, maintaining UChicago's legacy of excellence in collegiate Model UN competition.
    subtitle: "Leadership & Achievements"
    details: >
        Under my leadership, our team secured Best Large Delegation at Georgetown's National Collegiate Security 
        Conference (NCSC), the most prestigious fall competition in collegiate Model UN. Beyond competitive achievements, 
        this role has profoundly shaped my leadership philosophy and capabilities. I've developed expertise in strategic
         team management, personalized mentorship, and creating an inclusive team culture that balances competitive
          excellence with individual growth. Managing a large, diverse team through high-stakes competitions has honed 
          my skills in crisis management, adaptive leadership, and organizational development. This experience has become 
          the cornerstone of my undergraduate leadership journey, providing invaluable lessons in building and maintaining
           high-performing teams while fostering a supportive community atmosphere.
  - title: "Data Science Clinic"
    description: >
      In the Data Science Clinic, I'm contributing to a collaborative project with Inclusive Development International to
       enhance PalmWatch, a supply chain transparency tool for the palm oil industry. Our team is developing a comprehensive
        mapping system for human rights grievances, integrating this data with PalmWatch's existing supply chain tracking
         capabilities. This integration will enable users to monitor both corporate supply chains and associated human rights
          practices, creating a more robust accountability framework for the palm oil sector.
    subtitle: "Project Impact & Integration"
    details: >
      This project represents a perfect synthesis of my academic pursuits in data science and human rights. By applying
       data science methodologies to human rights documentation, we're creating actionable insights for corporate 
       accountability. Our work involves cleaning and structuring complex datasets of human rights violations, developing
        systematic mapping protocols, and ensuring seamless integration with the existing PalmWatch platform. This practical
         application of technical skills to advance human rights demonstrates the powerful intersection of technology and 
         social justice. The project exemplifies how data-driven approaches can enhance transparency in global supply chains 
         and strengthen mechanisms for protecting human rights in international business operations.
