  I was born in Northern California, where there were more cows than
  people; an emphasis on personal expression was paramount. When I turned
  ten, my family moved to western North Carolina, where I grew fond of the
  Mountains and learned the importance of personal connection and
  community.

  I'm passionate about music and enjoy sharing, performing, and simply
  listening to music with friends and family, a direct offshoot from the
  expression present in my upbringing.

  On the side, I search for activities and extracurriculars which not only
  provide chance for personal growth and improvement, but also a chance to
  positively impact others in a group setting. Building and growing
  community is where I find the greatest fulfillment.

  At the University of Chicago, I attempt to find the connection between
  Data Science and Human Rights by not only investigating how data
  negatively impacts and misrepresents the world around us but also work
  to see how existing data can be used to promote a more just society.
