  I was born in Northern California, where there were more cows than 
  people, and personal expression was paramount. When I turned ten, 
  my family moved to western North Carolina, where I grew fond of the
   mountains and learned the importance of personal connection and community.

  Music is my passion â€“ I love sharing, performing, and simply listening with 
  friends and family, a direct reflection of the expressive environment of my upbringing.

  I seek activities and extracurriculars that provide opportunities for both 
  personal growth and positive community impact. Building and growing community 
  is where I find the greatest fulfillment.
  
  At the University of Chicago, I explore the intersection of Data Science and Human 
  Rights, investigating how data can misrepresent our world while working to harness 
  existing data to promote a more just society.
