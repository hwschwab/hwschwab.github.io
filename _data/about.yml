  I was born in Northern California, where there were more cows than people, and personal expression was paramount. When I turned ten, my family moved to western North Carolina, where I grew fond of the mountains and learned the importance of personal connection and community.
  Music is my passion â€“ I love sharing, performing, and simply listening with friends and family, a direct reflection of the expressive environment of my upbringing. I seek activities and opportunities that provide both personal growth and positive community impact. Building and growing community is where I find the greatest fulfillment.
  I recently graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.S. in Data Science and a B.A. in Human Rights with Honors, where I explored the intersection of technology and human rights. My thesis examined how artificial intelligence systems challenge traditional privacy rights, specifically investigating the "right to be forgotten" in the age of Large Language Models. Throughout my undergraduate career, I led the Model UN team to maintain its fifth-place national ranking while transforming its culture to prioritize mutual respect and growth.
  I am now working as a Data Science and Human Rights Research Specialist at the World Bank's Data and Analytics Global Solutions Group within the Social Development Global Department, where I apply advanced methodologies to promote inclusive growth and address discrimination barriers affecting billions globally. My long-term goal is to work in AI governance and tech policy, harmonizing technical realities with legal frameworks to ensure responsible technology development. I'm particularly interested in how regulatory enforcement mechanisms can drive meaningful compliance rather than superficial adherence to emerging AI governance rules.
