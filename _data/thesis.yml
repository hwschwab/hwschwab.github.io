  For my thesis I am investigating the right to be forgotten and the onset
  of large language models (LLM) through an analysis of Meta's privacy
  policies in the EU, where the right is protected, and the United States,
  where it is not protected on the federal level.

importance: >
  As an emergent right, the right to be forgotten can provide us with the
  control over who collects, and stores our personal data. LLMs are
  quickly becoming the normal to use in your day to day activities, and
  are built on top of data that was collected without your knowledge. If
  someone wanted to remove their data in the past, they would submit a
  request to a company and processes would begin for their data to be
  expunged. But if the LLM is built on, even if a tiny part, of your
  personal data can this be protected? Meta operating within the EU and
  the US will need to navigate this tension, and I cant wait to see how it
  will play out.
