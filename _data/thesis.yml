  My thesis examines the right to be forgotten in the context of
   large language models (LLMs) by analyzing Meta's privacy policies 
   in the EU, where this right is protected, and the United States, where
    federal protection is absent.

  The right to be forgotten empowers individuals to control the collection
   and storage of their personal data. As LLMs become ubiquitous in daily life, 
   they raise new privacy concerns since they're trained on data collected without 
   explicit consent. While traditional data removal requests follow established
   procedures, LLMs present a unique challenge: how can personal data be protected 
   once it's incorporated into their training? Meta's operations in both the EU and 
   US serve as a case study for navigating these emerging tensions between privacy rights and AI development.
