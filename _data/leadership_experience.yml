    Under my leadership, our team secured Best Large Delegation at Georgetown's National Collegiate Security 
    Conference (NCSC), the most prestigious fall competition in collegiate Model UN. Beyond competitive achievements, 
    this role profoundly shaped my leadership philosophy and capabilities. I developed expertise in strategic
    team management, personalized mentorship, and creating an inclusive team culture that balanced competitive
    excellence with individual growth. Managing a large, diverse team through high-stakes competitions honed 
    my skills in crisis management, adaptive leadership, and organizational development. This experience became 
    the cornerstone of my undergraduate leadership journey, providing invaluable lessons in building and maintaining
    high-performing teams while fostering a supportive community atmosphere. Successfully managed an annual budget
    of $82,000+ and directed strategic resource allocation to increase conference participation nationwide.
