  description: >
    Currently, I am one of the presidents of the UChicago MUN competitive team. In this position I have had some of the most fulfilling experiences of my collegiate career.
    UChicago has never been ranked below fifth in the nation and there are no plans to end that now. Within this position, I lead trainings of sixty students on public speaking,
    international relations, project management, inclusive leadership, and collaboration.

    Most recently we received Best Large Delegation from NCSC, (Georgetown's yearly conference) which is the largest and most competitive of the fall.
    For me however, competitive success aside, this position has taught me the most about mentorship, leadership, and organization than any other activity or group I have been a part of.
