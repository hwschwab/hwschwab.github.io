    Under my leadership, our team secured Best Large Delegation at Georgetown's National Collegiate Security 
    Conference (NCSC), the most prestigious fall competition in collegiate Model UN. Beyond competitive achievements, 
    this role has profoundly shaped my leadership philosophy and capabilities. I've developed expertise in strategic
    team management, personalized mentorship, and creating an inclusive team culture that balances competitive
    excellence with individual growth. Managing a large, diverse team through high-stakes competitions has honed 
    my skills in crisis management, adaptive leadership, and organizational development. This experience has become 
    the cornerstone of my undergraduate leadership journey, providing invaluable lessons in building and maintaining
    high-performing teams while fostering a supportive community atmosphere.
