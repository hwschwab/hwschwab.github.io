            <h2>About Me </h2>
            <p>I was born in Northern California, where there were more cows than people; an emphasis on personal expression was paramount. When I turned ten, My family moved to western North Carolina, where I grew fond of the Mountains and learned the importance of personal connection and community.

                I'm passionate about music and enjoy sharing, performing, and simply listening to music with friends and family, a direct offshoot from the expression present in my upbringing.
                
                On the side, I search for activities and extracurriculars which not only provide chance for personal growth and improvement, but also a chance to positively impact others in a group setting. Building and growing community is where I find the greatest fulfillment.
                
                At the University of Chicago, I attempt to find the connection between Data Science and Human Rights by not only investigating how data negatively impacts and misrepresents the world around us but also work to see how existing data can be used to promote a more just society. </p>

            <h2>Current Activities </h2>
            <p>Here is all of my most important current activities, both professional and persoanlly.
                Typically I try to go for depth rather than bredth. In my final year of undergrad I have 
                found amazing experiences to feel embedded within the departments of both of my majors, 
                and found a thesis topic that combines my interests to research a topical, imporant, and exciting field. 
                <br>TLDR: this is what I am up to!</p>

                        <h3>My Thesis</h3>
                        <p>
                            For my thesis I am investigating the right to be forgotten and the onset of large language models (LLM)
                            through an analysis of Meta's privacy policies in the EU, where the right is protected, and the United States,
                             where it is not protected on the federal level. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="lb-r"> 
                        <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
                        <p>
                            As an imergant right, the right to be forgotten can provide us with the control over who collects, and stores our personal data.
                            LLMs are quickly becoming the normal to use in your day to day activities, and are build on top of data that was colelcted without your knowledge.
                            If someone wanted to remove their data in the past, they would submit a request to a company and processes would begin for their data to be expunged.
                            But if the LLM is built on, even if a tiny part, of your personal data can this be protected? Meta operating within the EU and the US will need to navigate 
                            this tension, and I cant wait to see how it will play out.

                        <p>The Pozen Center's Global Human Rights Lab accepts qualified undergraduate students to conduct research with the University of Chicago Law School's Global Human Rights Clinic.
                            On these teams, students work gathering data on human rights violations for use by the United Nations and other global partners.

                        This position will give me an oppritunity to develop qualitative research skills and connect me with impactful work in the human rights space. 
                        Working on impactful projects such as supporting the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions, or documenting civilian casualties in armed conflict truly is important work, and I feel honored to assist in this work. 
                        Lastly the ability to assist the work of the United Nations brings me full circle to my experience with Model UN, which ties a bow around a lot of mu focus in Undergrad.

                            Currently, I am one of the presidents of the UChicago MUN competitive team. In this position I have had some of the most fulfilling experiences of my collegiete career.
                            UChicago has never been ranked below fifth in the nation and there are no plans to end that now. Within this position, I lead trainings of sixty students on public speaking,
                            international relations, project management, inclusive leadership, and colaboration.

                            For me however, competitive success aside, this position has taught me the most about mentorship, leadership, and organization than any other activity or group I have been a part of.
